In my experience, prescriptive programming is generally easier to read and implement, especially for those familiar with imperative styles, as it offers clear, step-by-step instructions. However, functional programming promotes cleaner and more maintainable code through pure functions, making it better for scalability. I prefer prescriptive programming because it is very hard to find which functions I can use for different purposes and I would rather just use the basics to build up a solution. This is also because I am more comfortable with it, so I will try functional programming a little more and then think about which one I prefer.
